                            <p>Online Voting is a Online-based voting platform that allows you to create and manage your own election. Online Voting is much more than a platform - it's a revolution. Online Voting is what mobile banking is to cash transactions, Online Voting is what WhatsApp is to the postal department, Online Voting is what mobile share trading is to paper share trading.</p>
                            Today voting means - traveling to a booth, standing there in a queue for hours, getting hand inked to vote. Online Voting lets voters vote directly from their mobile, from the comforts of their homes, and that also within a few seconds.
                            <p>If you have to choose between spending Rs. 30,000 Crores, 2 months, and 1 Crore man-days to manage an election with a 66% voter turnout Vs spending less than 10% cost, 10% time, and 10% effort and still manage 10 times better security and close to 100% voter turnout - what would you choose?</p>

                            <p>Online Voting is a fight to ensure each and every citizen of the country gets his Right to Vote.

Nobody should be denied his Right to Vote due to his geographical location, his work commitments, his health issues, weather etc.Right to Vote is a mission to empower stakeholders and ensure that they get their Right to Vote.</p>
