                            <p>Online Voting is a Online-based voting platform that allows you to create and manage your own election. Online Voting is much more than a platform - it's a revolution. Online Voting is what mobile banking is to cash transactions, Online Voting is what WhatsApp is to the postal department, Online Voting is what mobile share trading is to paper share trading.</p>
                            <p>Today voting means - traveling to a booth, standing there in a queue for hours, getting hand inked to vote. Online Voting lets voters vote directly from their mobile, from the comforts of their homes, and that also within a few seconds.</p>
                            <p>If you have to choose between spending Rs. 30,000 Crores, 2 months, and 1 Crore man-days to manage an election with a 66% voter turnout Vs spending less than 10% cost, 10% time, and 10% effort and still manage 10 times better security and close to 100% voter turnout - what would you choose?</p>

                            <p>Online Voting is a fight to ensure each and every citizen of the country gets his Right to Vote. And Right to Vote is not limited to just the political election but each and every election be it housing society election, club election, professional body election or the national election. Nobody should be denied his Right to Vote due to his geographical location, his work commitments, his health issues, weather etc.Right to Vote is a mission to empower stakeholders and ensure that they get their Right to Vote.</p>

                            <p>We are a VOTING focused platform. We are not a market survey tool like Survey Monkey or opinion poll tool like poll daddy. Hence, we are also very focused on SECURITY and AUTHENICATION, unlike market survey or polling platforms where these are not major concern area.
                            We are a INDIA focused company. We would first like to make meaningful difference in our country before venturing abroad.
                            We are an ETHICS focused organization and would not take short cuts.</p>
