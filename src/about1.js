                            <p>We are a VOTING focused platform. We are not a market survey tool like Survey Monkey or opinion poll tool like poll daddy. Hence, we are also very focused on SECURITY and AUTHENICATION, unlike market survey or polling platforms where these are not major concern area.
                            We are a INDIA focused company. We would first like to make meaningful difference in our country before venturing abroad.
                            We are an ETHICS focused organization and would not take short cuts.</p>
